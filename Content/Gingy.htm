        <p>Gingy was created by the Muffin Man, along with the rest of the Gingerbread people. Some years later, he attended Cookie Academy, at which he excelled in Home Economics</p>
        <p>Sometime later, he got married to a red-head gingerbread woman, but the relationship did not last.</p>
        <p>Soon, gumdrop buttons were placed in to him, and he was brought in to the world.</p>
        <p>Shrek </p>
        <p>Gingy being tortured by Lord Farquaad.</p>
        <p>Gingy is being tortured by the evil Lord Farquaad. Farquaad had ordered his evil henchman Thelonious to drown Gingy in milk and rip off his legs so he couldn't escape. Farquaad went on to taunt him by making his legs run around while saying, "Run, run, run, as fast as you can! You can't catch me, I'm the Gingerbread Man!" and crumbled one of the legs to pieces. When Gingy wouldn't give Farquaad straight answers, he threatened to take off his gumdrop buttons. So the Gingerbread Man started to talk about how the Muffin Man was hiding them (most likely lying). When the Magic Mirror arrived, Gingy was thrown into the trash by Farquaad.</p>
        <p>At the end of the movie, Gingy is fine and his leg not crumbled by Lord Farquaad got glued back on with white glaze, while a candy cane made up for the lost one.</p>
